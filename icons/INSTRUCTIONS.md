# Extension Icons - Opera Style

Create the following Opera-style icon files in this directory:

- `icons/icon-16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icons/icon-32.png` (32x32 pixels)
- `icons/icon-48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icons/icon-128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Design Suggestions - Opera Style

- Use Opera's classic red color scheme (#FF1B2D or #CC0F1F)
- Incorporate Opera's signature "O" logo design
- Consider a recolored version of Opera's icon but adapted for Edge Canary
- Maybe include subtle Edge elements while maintaining Opera aesthetics
- Use Opera's modern flat design principles

## Icon Sources

1. **Option 1**: Download Opera icons from Opera's official resources and recolor them
2. **Option 2**: Create Opera-inspired icons using Opera's color palette
3. **Option 3**: Use existing Opera browser icons as reference

## Temporary Solution

For now, the extension will work without custom icons. Edge Canary will use default extension icons.

## Quick Creation

You can create Opera-style icons in any image editor:
1. Create new images in the sizes above
2. Use Opera red color (#FF1B2D) as the primary color
3. Create a circular or rounded square design similar to Opera's logo
4. Add white "O" or opera-style elements
5. Save as PNG files with the `opera-icon-` prefix
